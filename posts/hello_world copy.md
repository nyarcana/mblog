Lordy it's already been almost a month. I kind of intended to post more when I started this blog, but here we are.

There's a few things I need to get done on this blog. It's not super usable yet but I think we're close.

### 1. Automate deployment

Oh my god the current process sucks. It's litterally just scp'ing the files up. Like wtf am I doing. I'm not even a webdev and yet I can tell that sucks

### 2. Sort of the post dating

DYKG: The homepage doesn't sort the posts by date at all lmao. Works for one post, maybe 2 if I'm lucky. I'll probably implement that after this post

### 3. oowah, I forgot

I'm sure it was something important? Maybe better image support?

Honestly styling kinda sucks in general right now. I want more features and maybe something a bit less generic.


### 4. Socials

Need to throw my socials or something in the header. Like a true zoomer.

Speaking of which, hit me up here

Discord: @nyarcana

and nowhere else. Except here I guess. Hi.

I also have my own discord sever, but it's private and you're not invited. I'm sorry, it's not you. it's me.
