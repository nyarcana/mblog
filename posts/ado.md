Ado Hibana was amazing. Great performance from Ado and the whole band. Wish I brought ear plugs, but I'm doing alright.

The energy was the most amazing part. Everyone was so hyped and so in sync. So screaming from the crowd and
the crowd was awesome with their light wand things. I loved just being in that environment more than anything.
Also the fashion sense from people? Amazing. Loved some of the outfits I saw.

Now, if you'll allow the emotion dump, I think it made me realize that I'm kinda lonely? Or I guess put differently I feel like the people there were the type of people I'd like to spend time with but I don't have anyone like that in my life. I guess shared interests really are the root of relationships, who knew.

Unfortunately I didn't really talk with anybody while I was there. The line moved fast and I ended up getting seated between two couples. Totally an excuse, but whatever, it happened.

The question is, where do I find people like this again in the future? Obviously more Ado concerts, but that
strategy isn't exactly sustainable on the wallet. It feels like irl it's so hard to find fellow nerdy people because we all stay inside most of the time. Although maybe that's just me? I don't know. I guess I'm just saying
I think I found my people, but I don't know where they actually are.

If somebody is somehow reading this and knows, let me know.
