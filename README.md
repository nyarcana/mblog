# MBlog
A super basic static site generator for my blog. It doesn't work very well, but its mine.

## Build Instructions
Run `python3 build.py`. The compiled HTML and CSS files will be placed into the `build/` directory.

## Deploy
Once built, just rsync the files to where they should go dummy. We aren't webscale.
